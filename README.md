# Array-Challenge
Some work I did for class. 1-D and 2-D Array algorithms in java.
The OneArray class has a couple of methods that you can do with an array such as sorting, finding max and min, and reversing arrays. The TwoArray class also has soem methods that can sum the 2-D array's contents toegether, find the odd numbers in it, and find the max and min. I had fun figuring things out. This challenge helped me becoem mroe aware of the importance of scope. It took me a while to figure out that my print method was double printing because the print variable was outside of the method.
